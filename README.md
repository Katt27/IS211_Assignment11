# IS211 Assignment11 - Flask To-Do List Application

This repository hosts a simple Flask web application for managing a To-Do list. It allows users to add tasks, specify the email of the person responsible, and set a priority level (Low, Medium, High). Users can also clear the entire list with a single click.

## Features

- **Add To-Do Items**: Add tasks with descriptions, assign them to an email, and set a priority level.
- **View To-Do List**: All current tasks are displayed in a simple table format.
- **Clear To-Do List**: A single button to clear all entries from the list.
